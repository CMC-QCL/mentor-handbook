### Interview questions
- General interview questions for the next 8 minutes
  - What is your relationship with quantitative topics (Mathematics, Computer Science, Economics, Physics, etc.)?
  - What are kind of quantitative skills are you still trying to learn? 
  - What do you think the role the QCL is to the CMC and 5C community?
  - What role has the QCL played in your own development?
  - What do you think you can contribute to the QCL role?
  - Do you have experience tutoring or mentoring?
  - Do you have a tutoring philosophy?
  - Do you have any questions for us?
- We must avoid questions that imply bias towards or against the candidate's race, color, religion, sex (including gender identity, sexual orientation, & pregnancy), age, national origin, citizenship status, or disability.
  - It can be done by accident. Here are examples:
    - Candidate: “I volunteered with my church group to tutor children in math in Connecticut.”
    
      Mentor: “Oh that’s interesting, I’m from Connecticut too! What church do you go to?”
    - Candidate: “As a mixed person, I’ve struggled to find my place…”
    
      Mentor: “I struggle with that too sometimes. What are your identities, and where do you find campus support?”

- Thank the candidate and let them know the Directors will be in contact with them
