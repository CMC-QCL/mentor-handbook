# Effective teaching strategies (tips and tricks)
```
This is from "REED College: ACADEMIC SUPPORT TUTORING HANDBOOK: GUIDELINES & SUGGESTIONS"
```
Some of these strategies might not work for every student, but it is a good place to start. Review the list below before starting to tutor and  after to see if you can keep adding to the list below based on your customized experience.

- Break tutee’s difficulties into manageable chunks.
- Use questions to guide tutee without simply stating the answer.
- Direct students to work on patterns by showing they can attack a certain class of problems.
- When commenting on student’s work be specific in your comment.
- Always focus on progress, and share that with tutee.
- Give tutee chance to correct themselves.
- Try to utilize many examples to encourage your tutee to rethink materials from a different perspectives and expand their understanding.
- Make sure that your tutee is doing all is the work during the session.
- As a tutor, you should come prepared with materials to be covered during meeting session, and one strategy to be always prepared is to ask them questions about next meeting materials.
- Still, you are not expected to re-read articles, textbooks or re-do practice problems.

Try to provide help for tutees in terms of time-management, study skills, summarizing materials, and effective programming techniques. This is expected to fortify students’ learning capabilities in your session and during other sessions as well.
