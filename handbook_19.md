# Establishing a Professional Relationship with mentees

## One-on-one mentoring

- **How to start your first session:**
	- If possible, have your first session at QCL. It's a great chance to introduce students.
	- Offer your tutee a copy of QCL  **Handbook.**

- **Ask questions:**
	- Start a session with a new student by asking them what they want from tutoring and what questions they have about the process. Prompting students to understand their own learning needs and develop their own study plans helps motivate them towards self-sufficiency, which is the end goal in tutoring. In addition, establishing reasonable expectations upfront can help avoid difficulties later.
	- Chatting informally about their background and interest in the course may get the student actively involved and should help you assess the student's academic preparation. It will also help you both to establish goals for the tutoring relationship. However, keep it very professional, no personal Chatting is needed.
	- You can also use questions as an initial diagnostic tool to establish where their understanding ends, instead of where their confusion starts.
	- Listen to the answers! Practice active listening techniques.

- **Establish respectful guidelines:**
	- Both of you should agree to be on time, and determine how far in advance cancellations must be made.
	- Let them know that you expect them to go to lecture, lab, and/or conference; to take notes in class (if applicable); to attempt the homework before meeting with you; and, generally speaking, to be making a good faith effort in class.
	- Ask them to bring specific questions for you relating to the class or their homework to each session.
	- Remind your tutees that you’re not a replacement for faculty office hours, and tell them to expect you to refer them back to faculty regularly.
	- Remember that this is a professional relationship even though you are peers. If your tutoring relationship blossoms into a friendship (romantic or otherwise) honestly ask yourself if you can remain professional or if you should refer your new friend to another tutor.
	- At the end of the session, agree on what you will work on next time, and set up the next
meeting time/place.

# Effective teaching strategies (tips and tricks)

Some of these strategies might not work for every student, but it is a good place to start. Review the list below before starting to tutor and  after to see if you can keep adding to the list below based on your customized experience.

- Break tutee’s difficulties into manageable chunks.
- Use questions to guide tutee without simply stating the answer.
- Direct students to work on patterns by showing they can attack a certain class of problems.
- When commenting on student’s work be specific in your comment.
- Always focus on progress, and share that with tutee.
- Give tutee chance to correct themselves.
- Try to utilize many examples to encourage your tutee to rethink materials from a different perspectives and expand their understanding.
- Make sure that your tutee is doing all is the work during the session.
- As a tutor, you should come prepared with materials to be covered during meeting session, and one strategy to be always prepared is to ask them questions about next meeting materials.
- Still, you are not expected to re-read articles, textbooks or re-do practice problems.

Try to provide help for tutees in terms of time-management, study skills, summarizing materials, and effective programming techniques. This is expected to fortify students’ learning capabilities in your session and during other sessions as well. **Also, refer students to CMC Center for Academic Support -Not sure if this is true**

# Things to keep in mind

- **Learning Styles**:
	- Understanding your tutee’s learning styles and building your tutoring sessions around those strengths may make your sessions more productive.
	- Some resources for better learning:
		- http://www.vark-learn.com
		- http://www.learning-styles-online.com/inventory/questions.asp
	- Remember that your tutee may learn best in a way that’s different from yours.
- **Body Language**:
	- Use these common positive cues: turning your chair towards the tutee, nodding,
maintaining regular eye contact, smiling.
	- Remember these more subtle cues: don’t fold your arms, play with pens, or put your hands over your mouth.
	- Be aware that your personal comfort distance may be different from your tutees’.
- **Cultural Sensitivity**:
	- Students from other cultures may compose arguments in a manner that could be mistaken as an area of academic weakness.
	- Some cultures discourage students from disagreeing with authorities or challenging teachers and tutors.
	- Personal space, eye contact, speech volume, and even how questions are
phrased can be very culturally weighted.
	- If you feel like mis-communicated cultural cues are interfering with your tutoring sessions, try addressing the issue directly by approaching the topic with curiosity and openness.

# Potential (and Typical) Problems for Tutors and Tutees:
- **A tutee expects you to do the work for them or tell them the answers:**
Remind the student of the guidelines you established and that your primary goal is for them to be independent. If necessary, remind them of your shared responsibilities to uphold the Honor Principle.<br/>
- **An individual tutee who fails to show up for an appointment, or who shows up late:**
Follow whatever guidelines you set up in your first meeting (we suggest allowing one missed appointment). Stress the student’s responsibility in letting you know ahead of time (whatever time window you agreed on) if an appointment can’t be kept or if they are running late. If disrespectful behavior continues, end the tutoring with an explanation why.<br/>
- **A tutee who is not prepared for the session or is showing little effort:**
Students may be unprepared at the first session because they don't understand what tutoring is all about. A well-structured first session can eliminate this problem. You’ll most likely know that your tutee is coming ill-prepared to your sessions if you feel as though you’re doing all the work. In that case, you probably are! While most students who seek tutoring are genuinely motivated to do well, some tutees might still resist hard work. If the problem continues, explain their commitment and responsibilities to tutoring, as well as yours. Review their goals and priorities for the class to ensure you are meeting their needs most effectively. Talk with them about this, but again, let them do the work. You also might try rescheduling one appointment to make it clear you’re willing to work together if she/he comes prepared.<br/>
- **A tutee who is becoming too dependent:**
Begin by reviewing your responsibilities and goals with your tutee. This explanation might help them see the limits of your job as a peer tutor. Also consider ways you can wean the student by doing less and less for them. You can also suggest another tutor.
- **An angry student or one who is overly demanding:**
Just because tutoring is a service you are providing for compensation does not make it ok for anyone to be aggressive, mean, hostile or condescending to you. Ever. This is an Honor Principle issue at its core, and if it doesn’t feel like your tutee can see this, end the current session and either:
	1. Re-schedule with the understanding that they need to come back to the next session when they can behave in a respectful way, or
	2. Let them know that they will need to meet with David or Ryland before they can have more tutoring. If you choose this option, let David or Ryland know what
happened and they will meet with the student to discuss what’s going on.
- **A tutee who is insisting on an immediate session when you don't have time:**
It's sometimes hard to say no, but demanding behavior should not be encouraged; it sets a bad precedent and creates unrealistic expectations for the future. If you don’t have time to meet, they can meet with another tutor or see their faculty.
- **A tutee who complains about the professor:**
You may encounter a student who expresses their difficulties with a particular course by blaming poor teaching or a “bad” professor. While a shared opinion about that professor might strengthen your personal relationship with your tutee, it is unprofessional and will ultimately sidetrack the tutee from mastering the material.
- **During drop-in hours, too many students asking for help at once:**
In the tutoring centers, our basic model is first-come, first-served, which, as our center feedback confirms, can be frustrating for visitors on an especially busy night. Try a triage system that might identify common problems within the group, getting everyone busy, and then rotating, spending a few minutes with each student and then having them work as you move on to another. You can also consider asking students to work together, explain information to each other, and share their approaches to a problem.

- **A tutee whose academic difficulties appear to be more extensive than just one course or more than you can address through tutoring:**
Encourage them to see their course instructor and/or David or Ryland. As a tutor, you are there to help facilitate learning, but the instructor has the ultimate charge. Think about what questions you could help the student formulate as they prepare to meet with their professor. Struggling in multiple courses may be a sign of personal, health, psychological, or disability-related difficulties that could require a combination of resources and/or time away to solve. Refer tutees to Student Services so we can coordinate efforts to support students in academic crisis.
- **A tutee that divulges personal/health issues:**
Be human and caring, but recognize that you are not a clinician. Encourage the student to go to Health and Counseling. If the student does or says anything that gives you reason to be concerned about them, let QCL know right away.
