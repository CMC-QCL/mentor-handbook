This is what we all “quantitative literacy” and it’s growth is an understandable goal of any quantitative centers. However, what is also important is what we all “quantitative confidence,” the QCL’s version of student self-authorship. Understand that there are many students who may excel at their quantitative courses and know how to apply those learned skills, but lack any motivation to do so. If presented a quantitative problem in the real world, these students would automatically delegate the problem to someone they deem “a math person,” despite being perfectly capable of the task. We want to break this false dichotomy of “math people and non-math people” by showing students that quantitative skills are important in society, important to their personal goals, and are enjoyable to learn. As a mentor, your goal is to have students leavve the QCL with higher quantitative literacy and confidence. 3.2 QCL History The Murty Sunak Quantitative and Computing Lab was created by Dr. Jeho Park in 2018 as replacement to the existing Mathematical Sciences’ tutoring operation. One of the hallmarks of the CMC Mathematical Sciences department is it’s devotion to giving faculty agency in their teaching style, and this philosophy trickles down to how we train our mentors. Furthermore, the QCL is part of a triumverate of “student success” institutions which include the Center for Writing and Public Discourse (CWPD) and the Dean of Students (DoS) office, from which we modeled much of our structure. Since its inception, the QCL has grown and included Computer Science and Statistics courses from the Economics, Psychology, and Biology departments, along with logic from the Philosophy department. More recently, we have started support of the Kravis Integrated Science Department core courses. However, as we grow and are presented possible new courses to mentor for, we take care to only consider those that have a strong quantitative component with minimal redundancy with other, existing tutoring operations. 3.3 Who is the QCL for? The QCL is first and foremost a CMC organization, so CMC students can come to seek help in anything quantitative. This includes reasons that are not associated with any class they are currently enrolled in, such as their senior thesis, independent research, or just wanting to learn something new. This also includes any class they might be taking at one of the other 5Cs. For example, a CMC student taking CS 5 at HMC may still come to the QCL for help because they have that CMC privilege. What about students from the other colleges? Well, 5C students not from CMC may come to the QCL for help in quantitative courses that are housed at CMC. For example, a Pitzer student may seek mentoring for Math 30 because they are taking Math 30 at CMC. But this same student may not come to the QCL for help for any of the classes they are taking at Pitzer, Pomona, Scripps, or HMC. We try to mitigate these instances by making the rules clear in our appointment system, but students still try to break the rules. However, if a student who is not technically supposed to come for mentoring asks you for help, it is your prerogative on whether you help them or not; we do not want to place the burden of policing students on you. 3.4 Three Pillars of the QCL The QCL executes its mission statement in three ways Mentoring: We offer student mentors to help with courses in Math, CS, Stats, and Physics as well as various programming languages. Seniors can also seek help with their senior thesis from mentors. Workshops: Beginner and intermediate workshops are offered in programming and markdown languages such as Python, R, SQL, MATLAB, LaTeX, and more. These workshops are meant to be hands-on. Workshops are open to all students, faculty, and staff across all 7Cs, but registration is required. Consultation and Computational Resources: Students and faculty working on independent research can seek consultation services at the QCL for help with quantitative problems and accessing computational resources. These services are provided by the QCL directors and graduate fellows and can range from help running regression on data to parallelizing code for computational physics problems. 3.5 Three clients of the QCL Students: They come to gain quantitative literacy and quantitative confidence. Faculty: They need support for their courses. Mentors: They come to gain responsible leadership and pedagogical skills. 3.6 Deviate, but Track We want you to be able to explore different teaching styles. However, this can come into conflict with professors who want their content to be taught in a very strict way. So we ask that if you do deviate from the professor’s curriculum, always bring it back to it by the end of the Mentoring session. 3.7 Data Driven We collect a lot of data in a very thoughtful and intentional way. Part of your job description is to help us with this data collection. "],["new-mentor-onboarding.html", "4 New Mentor Onboarding 4.1 MyWCOnline 4.2 Discord 4.3 Availability Spreadsheet 4.4 New Mentor Training 4.5 Shadowing 4.6 Payroll 4.7 Card Swipe Access to the QCL 4.8 Mentor Webpage Picture", " 4 New Mentor Onboarding Welcome to the QCL! Here’s a list of everything you need to do to start mentoring: 4.1 MyWCOnline Our one-on-one appointment system is built around the web platform MyWCOnline. Each mentor will show up as a “resource” for students be able to book appointments with. Go to https://cmc.mywconline.net/ If you don’t already have an account, please register for a new account using your school email address. Make sure the option “Send me an email when my appointments are made, modified or canceled” is set to yes. Do not enter your phone number (having your phone number included sometimes prevents mentors from receiving email notifications). You will receive a verification email with a link you have to click to activate your account. Please do this right away or else you won’t be able to log in. 4.2 Discord We use Discord for internal communication at the QCL and it is an important way for the QCL Directors to communicate with mentors. If you’re unfamiliar, it’s very similar to Slack. If you already have a Discord account, we highly suggest you use your existing account instead of creating a new one for the QCL (some of you might be worried we’ll all see your screen name is something like PikachuCutie5000, but I’ll show you how to hide that). Click on the following QCL Discord Server invite link emailed to you by the QCL Asst. Director. If you do not already have a Discord account, this is where you will be prompted to create one. Otherwise, sign into your existing Discord account. Once you have access to the server, you will see only a few channels. This is because the QCL Directors need to grant you Mentor permissions, so please be patient. In the meantime, go to User Settings (also called Preferences). This can be accessed by clicking on the “gears button” often located on the bottom left of your Discord window. Go to the Profiles tab and Server Profiles. Select “The Murty Sunak Quantitative and Computing Lab” from the Choose A Server drop down list. Change your “nickname” to the following format: FirstName LastName ’GraduationYear Go to the Activity Privacy tab (it’s far down on the settings list on the left) There is a setting that says “Display current activity as status message” which is typically on by default. This means that anybody on Discord, including fellow mentors and QCL directors, will be able to see, under your name, what game you’re playing or what you’re listening to on Spotify. This is because Discord was built first and foremost as a communication tool for gamers. Anyway, if you don’t want us all to see how much Animal Crossing you’re playing, then feel free to turn this off. If you don’t already have it, please download, install, and log in to the Discord app on your phone. Go to Settings and Notifications Turn on push notifications for Discord messages. This might require you to turn on notifications in your phone’s system. Note that you will only receive push notifications when people intentionally use @YourNickName to ping you inside the QCL server. Eventually, the QCL Directors will give you permissions and access to all Mentor related channels, including one with your name on it. They will send you a test message to you in this channel. Please respond to the message to confirm it works. Once you have access, familiarize yourself with the #resources channel where you can find important links for your easy access. 4.3 Availability Spreadsheet The Availability Spreadsheet is a Google Sheet in which you will convey your Walk-in and One-on-one availability to the Asst. Director who will then propagate the information to Head Mentors and MyWCOnline. Click on the Availability Spreadsheet link provided in the #resources channel of the QCL Discord server. At the bottom, you will find various sheets. Find the one with your name on it. Note: there will always be one sheet with the Asst. Director’s name on it for you to view as a “test sheet” if you need a guide. At the top left of your sheet is a schedule of 1-hour time blocks for Sun through Friday. The 9am - 6pm time blocks are strictly for One-on-ones and the 7pm-9pm blocks are strictly for Walk-in blocks. For the One-on-one time blocks, click on each for which you are available to see a student for an appointment and change the color of the cell from white to green. Note: some time blocks will be grayed out for the mentor meeting, so you may not select these times for One-on-one availability. For the Walk-in time blocks, click on the two-hour session sets of cells and color them green if you will be available for that evening’s Walk-in session on a weekly basis. Please select both hours for the whole two-hour Walk-in session. Though it is possible to work only one of the 2 hours in one evening’s session, it can make things more difficult for Head Mentors to manage the session, so we would like to avoid it. On the right, you will find a list of all the topics the QCL offers. For the column labeled “One-on-ones,” for each subject you are comfortable mentoring a student for a full 1 hour session, put a capital Y in the corresponding cell. For the column labeled “Walk-ins,” for each subject you are comfortable mentoring a student during an evening Walk-in session, put a capital Y in the corresponding cell. Once you have finished filling out the availability sheet and you are fairly certain this will be your availability for the whole semester, please notify the Asst. Director in your personal Discord channel (the one named after you) to let them know you finished. If you ever need to change any information on your sheet after the semester begins, please discuss it with the Asst. Director first. Changes can be made, but it needs to be done in a consistent way, so do not just change things without telling the Asst. Director. 4.4 New Mentor Training You must attend the New Mentor Training session with the Asst. Director before you can mentor for the QCL (you are likely reading this because you currently are preparing for the training or already finished it). This typically is a 2 hour session. Contact the Asst. Director to schedule a time to complete the training if you missed the session scheduled at the beginning of the semester. You do get paid for your time in training, so please log that time once you are fully in CMC’s payroll system. 4.5 Shadowing You must also “shadow” an existing mentor before you can mentor for the QCL. This can be done during a Walk-in session or a One-on-one session. You only have to do one of the following: During a Walk-in session, wait for a mentor to start helping a student. Approach the mentor and ask for both their and the mentee’s permission to observe the teaching session. Observe the entire session or the first 10 minutes of it, which ever comes first. If another new mentor is already shadowing a session, we do not want to awkwardly over-crowd the student, so patiently wait for a different session to shadow. Notify one of the head mentors stationed that evening that you finished your shadowing and that you are now cleared to mentor so they can delegate mentees to you. At the next opportunity, send the Asst. Director a message in your private Discord channel that you have completed your shadowing. If you choose to shadow during a One-on-one, you will have to find an already-scheduled appointment on MyWCOnline with an existing mentor. You will need to contact the mentor (either in person, via email, or Discord) and ask for their permission to attend the appointment to shadow. Assuming the mentor agrees, when you attend the session, you will then need to seek the mentee’s permission to shadow. If they agree, you may observe the entire session or simply the first 10 minutes. At the next opportunity, send the Asst. Director a message in your private Discord channel that you have completed your shadowing. When you have completed a shadowing and let the Asst. Director know, they will unhide you from students in MyWCOnline so that they may book appointments with you. You will also be allowed to mentor students during the Walk-in sessions you are scheduled for. You do get paid for your time shadowing, so please log that time once you are fully in CMC’s payroll system. 4.6 Payroll As long as you filled out the Hiring Form you were linked to when you were first offered the job, the QCL Administrative Assistant has your information and will be working with Payroll to get you into their system and cleared for work. However, until they notify you that you are cleared to work, you may not do any mentoring. This is a strict rule the school has. In some cases, such as with international students with no social security number, you may be asked to provide extra documentation. You will be notified if this is the case. Do not hesitate to contact the QCL Administrative Assistant to inquire about the progress of your on-boarding into Payroll’s system. 4.7 Card Swipe Access to the QCL As long as you filled out the Hiring Form you were linked to when you were first offered the job, the QCL Administrative Assistant has your information and will be working with Story House to give you card access to the QCL. In some cases, such as with mentors who are not enrolled at CMC specifically, the process may take longer. Do not hesitate to contact the QCL Administrative Assistant to inquire about the progress of your on-boarding in Story House’s system. 4.8 Mentor Webpage Picture As a mentor, you will receive an official QCL t-shirt, but you are obligated to have your lovely picture taken with it on in front of the Veteran’s Patio fountain. This picture will be used on the QCL website at https://www.cmc.edu/qcl/mentors If there are extraneous reasons why it won’t be appropriate for your picture to be displayed publicly on the QCL website, please let the Asst. Director know.

The QCL Associate Director (Dr. Bhaven Mistry) mostly oversees the Mentoring operation and, thus, you will largely be dealing with them. They are in charge of hiring, training, and managing the mentors as well as conducting the mentor meetings. The QCL Program Coordinator (Dr. Vanessa Casillas) manages the QCL physical resources and payroll. If you have a problem with your pay or need more markers, this is who you would speak to. The QCL Graduate Fellows are graduate students (typically from CGU) working for the QCL to instruct workshops and help with the QCL’s administrative needs. They also provide consulting for research, senior thesis, and computational resources. As a Mentor, you will likely not interact with our Grad Fellows very much. 5.2 QCL Space As a mentor, consider the QCL as your home away from home. 5.2.1 Hours and Access The QCL front door is unlocked from 9am to 5pm, Mondays through Friday, and, thus, open to anyone to enter. Mentors have 24/7 access by swiping their ID card (once you’re through the system). Do not leave the door open; lizards like the air conditioned breeze coming from inside and will enter. They are very hard to remove! 5.2.2 Lounge Shared space for CMC students to work and get Mentoring Walls can be drawn on Erase your work when you’re done please! Two TVs have Apple Airplay capabilities (Lounge TV and Office TV) 5.2.3 Classroom The glass doors can open all the way. Walls and cupboards can be written on. Cupboards contain laptops, but are locked. Can ask QCL staff or a Head Mentor to check a laptop out to you. Sometimes reserved for QCL Workshops or Data Science Capstone meetings. 5.2.4 Conference Room The walls CANNOT be written on in here. This room can be reserved by any Mentor, faculty, or staff. Check the schedule next to the door before using it. Email the QCL Program Coordinator if you would like to reserve the room You can log into the computer with your CMC login info Owl camera has a 360 degree view Priority is given to QCL Staff and the Data Science Capstone, so your reservation can get bumped. 5.2.5 Kitchen Feel free to use the kitchen Wash your own dishes! Clear out any old food from the fridge you might have left. Drawers and cupboards contain utensils, plates, and cups. There are tea bags and sweetener in the cupboard above the sink. Snacks underneath the microwave. Email the QCL Program Coordinator if you want different snacks. First aid kit is located in one of the drawers and on top of the fridge. 5.2.6 Coffee Machine You’re free to use the very fancy coffee machine. Just make sure to keep clean. Clear out old grinds in the filter. Clean off burnt milk from steam wand. 5.2.7 Veteran’s Patio This is a public space, so is not reserved for the QCL. We conduct a lot of mentoring out here, so feel free to spread out and use it. However, parts of the space can be reserved by Story House. Check the tables for “Reserved” signs. If there isn’t one, you can assume it’s fine to use. During the Walk-in sessions, we have the space reserved for us. 5.2.8 Overflow Rooms (for Walk-in Sessions) Some combination of LC 61, LC 62, and LC 63 can be reserved by the QCL during the Walk-in sessions as “over flow rooms.” Good for when the weather isn’t fun outside. Physics mentoring tends to centralize in one of these rooms. The exact rooms tend to change each semester. The QCL Directors will let you know which ones we can use. 5.3 White Boards and Walls Small white boards can be moved outside to utilize the patio area. Make sure you bring it back in after you’re done. Each whiteboard should have a light on top so you can mentor in the dark. Clean white boards of all your work when you’re finished with them. Just use the provided erasers. DO NOT use any cleaning products on the white boards. 5.4 Laptops 5.5 Printer 5.6 Remote Mentoring Resources Small white boards Wacom One Tablets 5.7 Lost and Found Cupboard underneath the QCL Lounge TV If we find something, we’ll just automatically put it in there 5.8 The QCL Website If anyone wants info about the QCL, just send them to our website. www.cmc.edu/qcl "],["one-on-one-appointments.html", "6 One on One Appointments 6.1 General procedure 6.2 During the One-on-one 6.3 Blacking out times 6.4 Your schedule", " 6 One on One Appointments 6.1 General procedure Student checks schedule and filters mentors for their subject They find your availability, click on a time block and make an appointment Will put their professor’s name and description of what they need help with Will also have to pledge to make sure they don’t book you within 24 hours of the appointment and that they’re eligible to receive mentoring (CMC student or non-CMC taking a CMC course) You will get an email notification about the appointment. You can go into MyWCOnline and click on the appointment block to see more info You can click on the student’s name to find their contact info and school. Email the student to tell them how you’re going to meet them. If physical meeting, feel free to use the QCL. If an online-only meeting, send them a Zoom link (or preferred alternative). If the student booked within 24 hours of the appointment, you have the right to cancel the meeting, but still email the student letting them know. Meet the student at the designated place at the the beginning of the meeting. Be punctual! QCL staff will message you on Discord if you forget and the students asks us where you are. If the student is late, wait 20 minutes before considering it a “no-show.” You can mark the student a no-show for that appointment in MyWCOnline. There are strict consequences! 6.2 During the One-on-one Spend the first few minutes outlining how you plan to conduct the entire session Doesn’t need to be detailed; just enough for the to see you have a plan. Give a lot of prompt encouragement and positive reinforcement. For the last 5 minutes, ask the mentee to summarize what you covered back to you. 6.3 Blacking out times Cancelling appointments on students for non-legitimate reasons is no good! Proactively block out times if you even feel like you won’t be available certain dates. No need to ask for permission from QCL staff; just go ahead and block it out In MyWCOnline, in the upper left, underneath your name, you will find a button that looks like a box with an X on it. This turns on “black out mode” and will let you click on time blocks to make unavailable to students. DO NOT make an appointment with yourself to black out times; it messes with our data. 6.4 Your schedule There can be limits to how many appointments you can receive. 3 appointments max per day set as default. No limit on appointments per week set by default. You can ask the QCL Directors to change these limits if you like. If you want to change your availability, discuss with a QCL Director It can be a little bit of a pain to do, so be patient. If you change your schedule on the Availability Spreadsheet, LET THE ASST.

In the mean time, you can do homework or chat with fellow mentors, but proactively look for students who need help. Do not hide inside a close room somewhere to finish studying or some homework; you are here to help other students, so make yourself present and available. 7.3 During the session Have the mentee scan your check-in QR code This is located on the back side of your QCL badge If you are in the middle of a group session, still require each new student that walks up to scan the QR code 7.4 Head Mentors Are In Charge They are managing the entire session They check your attendance and report directly to the QCL Directors about problems They delegate mentees to mentors. They also manage the logistics and clean-up of the session. If they tell you to help move things around or clean-up, you must comply. Even if you plan to mentor in an overflow room (such as for Physics), you must still check in with a head mentor at the beginning of the Walk-in. 7.5 Too many students! Never feel obligated to stay later than 9pm. Let the student know they can book an appointment Notify the QCL Directors if you feel unsafe.

General announcements: Via Discord with no ping Requires action, but not immediately: Via email Requires immediate action: Via Discord with a ping The QCL Directors admit they’re not the best at following this exactly… 10.1 Discord This is the primary way we communicate with each, via between QCL staff and mentors, or between mentors themselves. #resources is a read-only channel where the QCL Directors post links to important forms and information. This is to make access quick and easy for the mentors. #mentor-chat is for general discussions amongst mentors about mentorng matters as well as important and not-so-important announcements and requests from QCL Directors. This is also where you will let the @headmentors know when you can’t make it to a Walk-in session. #random is for non-mentoring related discussions and announcements, but it has mostly turned into a place for the QCL Directors to post positive feedback we receive from student mentees in their Exit Form responses. #physics-chat is visible only to physics mentors, mostly because many homework solutions are shared here. QCL General Space is a collection of channels that is supposed to be open to all students. This is because there are lofty goals to open the QCL Discord server to all students and not just Mentors. As of now, however, it has not been implemented that way yet. However, the #fun-math-stuff is the most active channel there where we like to post our favorite math/programming memes. 10.2 Email The QCL staff will generally reserve email for topics that require action on your part.

You, instead, help them come to the answers themselves. This is relatively straight forward, but there are some gray areas, so let us explore the three general reasons mentees come to the QCL seeking your help in the official capacity as a mentor and we will explore each one separately. 13.1 Situation 1: The student wants the answer to a specific problem This is an automatic no. If this problem is coming from a homework assignment, practice exam, or even some random question they found on the internet, if you know how to solve it, then you should help them find a way to solve it themselves. It’s the only way they will develop quantitative knowledge and skills. 13.2 Situation 2: The student wants help arriving at the answer to a specific problem This may seem okay, but in some situations it is not. You should ask the student “where is this problem coming from?” If the student says it came from a homework or practice exam, you can help them. If it is the case that the professor of this student explicitly bars the student from seeking help at the QCL on these problems, it is the responsibility of the student to not ask you for help, and, thus, you are protected. This is because they would have answered a academic integrity pledge in the Check-in form you had them fill out before helping them. If the student says it came from a take-home exam, you cannot help them. 13.3 Situation 3: The student wants information on a general quantitative subject with no specific problem in mind This seems the most innocuous situation, but there could still be some academic integrity at stake. This is because this student might be in the middle of a take-home exam. Exams, even take-home ones, are, by default, closed everything (notes, books, internet, and QCL). Thus, this student should not be seeking help in that generalize topic. For example, a Calc 2 student has a take-home exam and goes to the QCL with a general question about infinite series, with no specific problem in mind. Technically, this it not okay. Only if the professor gave explicit permission to their students that they are allowed to go to the QCL, may the student get help. 13.4 We Got Your Back As a QCL mentor, it is not your official obligation to be the academic integrity police. You may or may not report incidences of academic dishonesty, but that is as a responsible student of the Claremont Colleges. However, students may game the system and you may find yourself participating in academic dishonesty without your knowledge. This is why you need to take the bare minimum steps of having each mentee fill out the Check-in form (and thus, the pledge for academic integrity) and ask them where specific problems came from. As long as you do these, the QCL will defend your integrity to any allegations of wrong doing. "],["disciplinary-protocol.html", "14 Disciplinary Protocol 14.1 Unexcused Walk-in Attendance 14.2 Mentor No-Show for One-on-ones", " 14 Disciplinary Protocol At this time, the QCL has implemented a disciplinary policy for two types of offenses: unexcused Walk-in attendance and Mentor no-shows for a one-on-one. 14.1 Unexcused Walk-in Attendance This is when a Mentor is scheduled a Walk-in session and fails to let a head mentor know that they will be absent from that session prior to the session. The head mentor will mark that mentor as “Missing” in the attendance sheet for the QCL Directors to review the next day. These absences are very disruptive for the head mentors to delegate mentees to appropriate mentors and minimizes our ability to consistently offer help to students. First offense will result in a message/email from a director asking for an explanation for your absence and failure to notify the head mentors. Second offense will result in a message/email from a director asking for an explanation for your absence and failure to notify the head mentors. Third offense will result in a message/email from a director asking for an explanation for your absence and failure to notify the head mentors. Fourth offense will result in a suspension of being able to continue mentoring in any capacity till you conduct a meeting (either in person or remotely) to discuss the repeated unexcused absences. This is also a chance for you to end your employment in a mutually agree way. Fifth offense results in termination of your employment at the QCL. This prevents any of the graduation benefits such receiving a QCL stole. 14.2 Mentor No-Show for One-on-ones A no-show for a mentor during a one-on-one is if a student shows up to the appointment, but the mentor does not, nor do they communicate to either the mentee or the QCL staff about their whereabouts. The typical scenario is a student shows up at the QCL and asks staff where their mentor is, at which point the staff member will ping the mentor on Discord and wait for a response. If there is no response from the mentor for the entire session, this is a no-show. These incidences are extremely damaging to the professionalism and integrity of the QCL. First offense will result in a message/email from a director asking for an explanation for your no-show. Second offense will result in a message/email from a director asking for an explanation for your no-show. Third offense will result in a message/email from a director asking for an explanation for your no-show. Fourth offense will result in a suspension of being able to continue mentoring in any capacity till you conduct a meeting (either in person or remotely) to discuss the repeated no-shows. Fifth offense results in a ban on mentoring one-on-ones. You will still be allowed to mentor for Walk-in sessions, but you are now not in good standing with the QCL as a Mentor. This prevents any of the graduation benefits such receiving a QCL stole.

You should have card access to the QCL fairly quickly If you are a non-CMC student, you will have to go to Story House to get that setup. The QCL Admin. Assistant will give you instructions. Check if you still have access to the Discord Server and turn on push notifications on your phone. If you lost access, contact the Asst. Director to regain access. Fill out the Availability Worksheet, which is linked in the #resources channel in Discord 16.2 Taking a Semester Off Sometimes you need to go abroad or semester just get tough, so if you don’t think you have enough bandwidth to be an effective QCL Mentor, feel free to take a semester off. Note that if you make this decision in the middle of the semester, that semester will not count as a “full semester” worked as a Mentor. Just discuss it with the QCL Directors. You will lose the “Mentor role” in the QCL Discord Server and no longer have access to the Mentor channels, but you will still have the “Student role.” Your private chat will remain. We strongly recommend you do not leave the server, in case you return. Your picture and profile may remain on the QCL Mentors webpage till after you graduate. 16.3 Graduating If you are eligible for a QCL Stole, come by and pick one up (and wear it over all the other ones!) The QCL Directors will likely “connect” to you on LinkedIn You will lose the “Mentor” and “Student” roles in the QCL Discord, but will have the “Alumni” role, which gives you a very limited access to channels. Your private chat will remain. If you really would rather leave the server at this time, please say a good by message in the private chat.

"],["interviewing-procedure.html", "18 Interviewing Procedure 18.1 Main Goal of the Mentor-led Interview 18.2 Interview Timeline", " 18 Interviewing Procedure 18.1 Main Goal of the Mentor-led Interview Assess the candidate’s skill at communicating the quantitative topic they chose during their Mini Teaching clearly and pedagogically. Assess the candidate’s understanding of the quantitative topic they chose for their Mini Teaching using follow-up questions a student might ask. Answer any questions the candidate has about the position from a Mentor’s point of view. 18.2 Interview Timeline 18.2.1 Before the Interview Put your name down on the interview schedule. A link to the Interview Schedule is located in the #resources channel of Discord. No more than 3 Mentors per interview. Ideally 2 and then one alternate. You decide if it is appropriate for you to be at the interview. We trust you to not implement personal bias. Block out all times in WCOnline for which you will be attending interviews. You do get paid for the hour you dedicated for this interview. Show up 5 minutes earlier than the interview time. Only Mentors should be interviewing; do not let other random students attend. 18.2.2 Meet and Greet Greet the candidate when they arrive. They might not know where the QCL Classroom is. Introduce yourselves first and tell them about your experiences as a Mentor and how long you’ve worked at the QCL. The point of this time is to create a friendly, low anxiety environment for the candidate. Ask them if they have any questions for you about the position or the QCL. Give your perspective as a Mentor. This is really their chance to interview us. Don’t spend more than 10 minutes chatting like this. You can cut it as short as you want. 18.2.3 Mini Teaching 10-12 minutes. One Mentor must decide to “conduct” the Mini-Teaching. Explain to them that you will signal “2 minutes left” at the 10 minute mark Start a timer and let them know when to start Signal them at the 10 minute mark Feel free to cut them off at 12 minutes, but you can decide if you want to let them go a little longer to finish up. Things to look out for: Do they state the objective of the problem clearly at the beginning? Do they define all terms, variables, and symbols they introduce? Are they keeping the technical details and jargon at a level a student will understand? Do they break the problem up in clear steps? Do they clearly state or summarize the solution of the problem when they’re done? Is their white board management clean and organized? Do they engage the student with occasional questions? Do they have to backtrack to fix any mistakes? Do they say anything mathematically or technically inaccurate? 18.2.4 Follow-up Questions on the Mini Teaching 8 minutes maximum. Ask questions a student might ask or legitimate questions you might have. Keep the focus of the questions on the Mini Teaching they just did and not about their background. Feel free to give a helping hand if they’re stumped. You may give helpful suggestions and constructive criticism of the Mini Teaching, but be nice about it! 18.2.5 End of Interview Thank them for coming and tell them they’ll hear back from the QCL Directors after all interviews are done. 18.2.6 Fill out the Interview Feedback Form Linked in the #resources channel of Discord DO NOT fill out this form while the candidate is present! After the candidate has left, discuss with the other Mentors present and fill out the form. It’s not very long and you can provide as much commentary as you feel necessary.
