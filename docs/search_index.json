This is the south side of the Kravis Lower Court next to the Veterns Patio.” If you have to call an external paramedics and direct them to our location, please say “we are located just east of 888 N. Columbia Avenue. We are in the lower court area immediately underneath the glass cube surrounded by water on campus. If you go down the stairs immediately south of the cube, you should see a sign for the Murty Sunak Quantitative and Computing Lab in the corner. We are in there.” 1.3 First Aid We keep a first aid kit on top of the fridge. We also have a supplementary first aid kit and bandages in the right-most kitchen drawer for needs that aren’t necessarily an emergency. 1.4 Fire Safety A fire extinguisher is located adjacent to the front door. 1.5 Earthquake Safety (Need to add safe location) 1.6 Mask Policy 1.7 QCL Staff Contacts Jeho Park (Director): (909) 607 dash 8526 Bhaven Mistry (Asst.

This is what we all “quantitative literacy” and it’s growth is an understandable goal of any quantitative centers. However, what is also important is what we all “quantitative confidence,” the QCL’s version of student self-authorship. Understand that there are many students who may excel at their quantitative courses and know how to apply those learned skills, but lack any motivation to do so. If presented a quantitative problem in the real world, these students would automatically delegate the problem to someone they deem “a math person,” despite being perfectly capable of the task. We want to break this false dichotomy of “math people and non-math people” by showing students that quantitative skills are important in society, important to their personal goals, and are enjoyable to learn. As a mentor, your goal is to have students leavve the QCL with higher quantitative literacy and confidence. 2.2 QCL History The Murty Sunak Quantitative and Computing Lab was created by Dr. Jeho Park in 2018 as replacement to the existing Mathematical Sciences’ tutoring operation. One of the hallmarks of the CMC Mathematical Sciences department is it’s devotion to giving faculty agency in their teaching style, and this philosophy trickles down to how we train our mentors. Furthermore, the QCL is part of a triumverate of “student success” institutions which include the Center for Writing and Public Discourse (CWPD) and the Dean of Students (DoS) office, from which we modeled much of our structure. Since its inception, the QCL has grown and included Computer Science and Statistics courses from the Economics, Psychology, and Biology departments, along with logic from the Philosophy department. More recently, we have subsumed the Keck Science Physics tutoring operation. However, as we grow and are presented possible new courses to mentor for, we take care to only consider those that have a strong quantitative component with minimal redundancy with other, existing tutoring operations. 2.3 Who is the QCL for? The QCL is first and foremost a CMC organization, so CMC students can come to seek help in anything quantitative. This includes reasons that are not associated with any class they are currently enrolled in, such as their senior thesis, independent research, or just wanting to learn something new. This also includes any class they might be taking at one of the other 5Cs. For example, a CMC student taking CS 5 at HMC may still come to the QCL for help because they have that CMC privilege. What about students from the other colleges? Well, 5C students not from CMC may come to the QCL for help in quantitative courses that are housed at CMC. For example, a Pitzer student may seek mentoring for Math 30 because they are taking Math 30 at CMC. But this same student may not come to the QCL for help for any of the classes they are taking at Pitzer, Pomona, Scripps, or HMC. We try to mitigate these instances by making the rules clear in our appointment system, but students still try to break the rules. However, if a student who is not technically supposed to come for mentoring asks you for help, it is your prerogative on whether you help them or not; we do not want to place the burden of policing students on you. 2.4 Three Pillars of the QCL The QCL executes its mission statement in three ways Mentoring: We offer student mentors to help with courses in Math, CS, Stats, and Physics as well as various programming languages. Seniors can also seek help with their senior thesis from mentors. Workshops: Beginner and intermediate workshops are offered in programming and markdown languages such as Python, R, SQL, MATLAB, LaTeX, and more. These workshops are meant to be hands-on. Workshops are open to all students, faculty, and staff across all 7Cs, but registration is required. Consultation and Computational Resources: Students and faculty working on independent research can seek consultation services at the QCL for help with quantitative problems and accessing computational resources. These services are provided by the QCL directors and graduate fellows and can range from help running regression on data to parallelizing code for computational physics problems. 2.5 Three clients of the QCL Students: Faculty: Mentors: 2.6 Deviate, but Track 2.7 Data Driven "],["new-mentor-onboarding.html", "3 New Mentor Onboarding 3.1 MyWCOnline 3.2 Discord 3.3 Availability Spreadsheet 3.4 New Mentor Training 3.5 Shadowing 3.6 Payroll 3.7 Card Swipe Access to the QCL 3.8 Mentor Webpage Picture", " 3 New Mentor Onboarding Welcome to the QCL! Here’s a list of everything you need to do to start mentoring: 3.1 MyWCOnline Our one-on-one appointment system is built around the web platform MyWCOnline. Each mentor will show up as a “resource” for students be able to book appointments with. Go to https://cmc.mywconline.net/ If you don’t already have an account, please register for a new account using your school email address. Make sure the option “Send me an email when my appointments are made, modified or canceled” is set to yes. Do not enter your phone number (having your phone number included sometimes prevents mentors from receiving email notifications). You will receive a verification email with a link you have to click to activate your account. Please do this right away or else you won’t be able to log in. 3.2 Discord We use Discord for internal communication at the QCL and it is an important way for the QCL Directors to communicate with mentors. If you’re unfamiliar, it’s very similar to Slack. If you already have a Discord account, we highly suggest you use your existing account instead of creating a new one for the QCL (some of you might be worried we’ll all see your screen name is something like PikachuCutie5000, but I’ll show you how to hide that). Click on the following invite link to access the QCL Discord server: https://discord.gg/Pv8rkcw If you do not already have a Discord account, this is where you will be prompted to create one. Otherwise, sign into your existing Discord account. Once you have access to the server, you will see only a few channels. This is because the QCL Directors need to grant you Mentor permissions, so please be patient. In the meantime, go to User Settings (also called Preferences). This can be accessed by clicking on the “gears button” often located on the bottom left of your Discord window. Go to the Profiles tab and Server Profiles. Select “The Murty Sunak Quantitative and Computing Lab” from the Choose A Server drop down list. Change your “nickname” to the following format: FirstName LastName ’GraduationYear Go to the Activity Privacy tab (it’s far down on the settings list on the left) There is a setting that says “Display current activity as status message” which is typically on by default. This means that anybody on Discord, including fellow mentors and QCL directors, will be able to see, under your name, what game you’re playing or what you’re listening to on Spotify. This is because Discord was built first and foremost as a communication tool for gamers. Anyway, if you don’t want us all to see how much Animal Crossing you’re playing, then feel free to turn this off. If you don’t already have it, please download, install, and log in to the Discord app on your phone. Go to Settings and Notifications Turn on push notifications for Discord messages. This might require you to turn on notifications in your phone’s system. Note that you will only receive push notifications when people intentionally use @YourNickName to ping you inside the QCL server. Eventually, the QCL Directors will give you permissions and access to all Mentor related channels, including one with your name on it. They will send you a test message to you in this channel. Please respond to the message to confirm it works. Once you have access, familiarize yourself with the #resources channel where you can find important links for your easy access. 3.3 Availability Spreadsheet The Availability Spreadsheet is a Google Sheet in which you will convey your Walk-in and One-on-one availability to the Asst. Director who will then propagate the information to Head Mentors and MyWCOnline. Click on https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1aWaWi5MVMusRco8B1rC0xOeh-g2oE9-_sXgGvLGEZqM/edit#gid=0 At the bottom, you will find various sheets. Find the one with your name on it. Note: there will always be one sheet with the Asst. Director’s name on it for you to view as a “test sheet” if you need a guide. At the top left of your sheet is a schedule of 1-hour time blocks for Sun through Friday. The 9am - 6pm time blocks are strictly for One-on-ones and the 7pm-9pm blocks are strictly for Walk-in blocks. For the One-on-one time blocks, click on each for which you are available to see a student for an appointment and change the color of the cell from white to green. Note: some time blocks will be grayed out for the mentor meeting, so you may not select these times for One-on-one availability. For the Walk-in time blocks, click on the two-hour session sets of cells and color them green if you will be available for that evening’s Walk-in session on a weekly basis. Please select both hours for the whole two-hour Walk-in session. Though it is possible to work only one of the 2 hours in one evening’s session, it can make things more difficult for Head Mentors to manage the session, so we would like to avoid it. On the right, you will find a list of all the topics the QCL offers. For the column labeled “One-on-ones,” for each subject you are comfortable mentoring a student for a full 1 hour session, put a capital Y in the corresponding cell. For the column labeled “Walk-ins,” for each subject you are comfortable mentoring a student during an evening Walk-in session, put a capital Y in the corresponding cell. Once you have finished filling out the availability sheet and you are fairly certain this will be your availability for the whole semester, please notify the Asst. Director in your personal Discord channel (the one named after you) to let them know you finished. If you ever need to change any information on your sheet after the semester begins, please discuss it with the Asst. Director first. Changes can be made, but it needs to be done in a consistent way, so do not just change things without telling the Asst. Director. 3.4 New Mentor Training You must attend the New Mentor Training session with the Asst. Director before you can mentor for the QCL (you are likely reading this because you currently are preparing for the training or already finished it). This typically is a 2 hour session. Contact the Asst. Director to schedule a time to complete the training if you missed the session scheduled at the beginning of the semester. You do get paid for your time in training, so please log that time once you are fully in CMC’s payroll system. 3.5 Shadowing You must also “shadow” an existing mentor before you can mentor for the QCL. This can be done during a Walk-in session or a One-on-one session. You only have to do one of the following: During a Walk-in session, wait for a mentor to start helping a student. Approach the mentor and ask for both their and the mentee’s permission to observe the teaching session. Observe the entire session or the first 10 minutes of it, which ever comes first. If another new mentor is already shadowing a session, we do not want to awkwardly over-crowd the student, so patiently wait for a different session to shadow. Notify one of the head mentors stationed that evening that you finished your shadowing and that you are now cleared to mentor so they can delegate mentees to you. At the next opportunity, send the Asst. Director a message in your private Discord channel that you have completed your shadowing. If you choose to shadow during a One-on-one, you will have to find an already-scheduled appointment on MyWCOnline with an existing mentor. You will need to contact the mentor (either in person, via email, or Discord) and ask for their permission to attend the appointment to shadow. Assuming the mentor agrees, when you attend the session, you will then need to seek the mentee’s permission to shadow. If they agree, you may observe the entire session or simply the first 10 minutes. At the next opportunity, send the Asst. Director a message in your private Discord channel that you have completed your shadowing. When you have completed a shadowing and let the Asst. Director know, they will unhide you from students in MyWCOnline so that they may book appointments with you. You will also be allowed to mentor students during the Walk-in sessions you are scheduled for. You do get paid for your time shadowing, so please log that time once you are fully in CMC’s payroll system. 3.6 Payroll As long as you filled out the Hiring Form you were linked to when you were first offered the job, the QCL Administrative Assistant has your information and will be working with Payroll to get you into their system and cleared for work. However, until they notify you that you are cleared to work, you may not do any mentoring. This is a strict rule the school has. In some cases, such as with international students with no social security number, you may be asked to provide extra documentation. You will be notified if this is the case. Do not hesitate to contact the QCL Administrative Assistant to inquire about the progress of your on-boarding into Payroll’s system. 3.7 Card Swipe Access to the QCL As long as you filled out the Hiring Form you were linked to when you were first offered the job, the QCL Administrative Assistant has your information and will be working with Story House to give you card access to the QCL. In some cases, such as with mentors who are not enrolled at CMC specifically, the process may take longer. Do not hesitate to contact the QCL Administrative Assistant to inquire about the progress of your on-boarding in Story House’s system. 3.8 Mentor Webpage Picture As a mentor, you will receive an official QCL t-shirt, but you are obligated to have your lovely picture taken with it on in front of the Veteran’s Patio fountain. This picture will be used on the QCL website at https://www.cmc.edu/qcl/mentors If there are extraneous reasons why it won’t be appropriate for your picture to be displayed publicly on the QCL website, please let the Asst. Director know.

The QCL Assistant Director (Dr. Bhaven Mistry) mostly oversees the Mentoring operation and, thus, you will largely be dealing with them. They are in charge of hiring, training, and managing the mentors as well as conducting the mentor meetings. The QCL Administrative Assistant (Janna Shwaiko) manages the QCL physical resources and payroll. If you have a problem with your pay or need more markers, this is who you would speak to. The QCL Graduate Fellows are graduate students (typically from CGU) working for the QCL to instruct workshops and help with the QCL’s administrative needs. They also provide consulting for research, senior thesis, and computational resources.
